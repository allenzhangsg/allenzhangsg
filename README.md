## 👋 Hello！ This is Allen
I'm a software engineer at Connexion Mobility and a senior data engineer who used to work for Tesla and Meituan.
My professional skills include data engineering, software development, and a tip in the DevOps area.

I love the software industry because I find it charming. I've started contributing to the community 
after many years of learning from it. 

If you find my projects useful, please leave a star⭐.

You can also contact me via [allenzhangsg@gmail.com](mailto:allenzhangsg@gmail.com).

Good luck!
